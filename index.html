<p class="about-me">Hello! My name is Zion Ogden.
  I'm currently concentrating on web development, which is what I'd like
my career to be. I've always found coding, in general, to be fascinating. So out
of the list majors that satisfied my scholarship requirements, Entertainment
Technologies seemed like the obvious choice. For fun, I either play video games
or read novels. I briefly considered a career in video game development but I decided
against it. I love playing video games but that love doesn't necessarily transfer
to making video games. </p>
